VINPOCETINE: TECHNICAL SUMMARY
</H1>
<font size=4>
<p style="color:#009F00; font-family:lucida console">
Vinpocetine [continuous nootropic]<br>
<br>
Dosing: 10mg, closely watch for adverse reaction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10mg 3x daily thereafter<br>
<br>
Reason for use: Promotes memory; neuroprotective, increases cerebral blood flow
[Note: Personal experience and additional research has led me to conclude that
Vinpocetine does not have a beneficial effect at low (<20mg) doses in normal
test subjects. This section will be revised to include that research; for my
subjective experience, read my personal log.]<br>
<br>
Data on vinpocetine is sketchy. Several studies show improvement in memory, but a cochrane review found "although the basic science is interesting, the evidence for beneficial effect ... is inconclusive...". However, vinpocetine has no significant negative side effects or drug intereactions, so I will see for myself what its effects are -- in vitro studies find neurogenerative and neuroprotective effects.<br>

Vinpocetine administered before task learning increased duration of memory retention.<br>
}<br>
<br>
Reason for dosing: Most studies tested vinpocetine at 10mg 3x daily. Furthermore, a paper claiming synergistic effects with Piracetam indicated a ratio of 5mg vinpocetine to 400mg Piracetam, so 10mg 3x daily is in line with my Piracetam dosage.<br>

Notes synergistic nootropic effects, proposes ratio of 400mg Piracetam:5mg Vinpocetine.<br>
