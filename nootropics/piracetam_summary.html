PIRACETAM: TECHNICAL SUMMARY
</H1>
<font size=4>
<p style="color:#009F00; font-family:lucida console">
Piracetam [continuous nootropic]<br>
<br>
Dosing: 1.6g 3x daily for 3 days (attack dose)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.8g 3x daily thereafter<br>
Taking <a href="choline.html">choline</a> with piracetam is highly recommended<br>
<br>
Reason for use: promotes verbal memory, increases cerebral blood flow<sup>1</sup><br>
<br>
Reason for dosing: 4.8g/day promotes rapid onset of effects, but leads to tolerance. Therefore, an "attack dose" of 4.8g/day is taken, then dosage is reduced to 2.4g/day -- this should promote rapid onset of effects while avoiding tolerance<sup>2</sup>. Some studies in alcohol-induced brain dysfunction show 4.8g/day as necessary for effectiveness<sup>3</sup>, but normal humans are closer to mildly impaired than severely impaired, so data from trials on mildly impaired subjects should be used in calculating dosage for normal man.<br>
<br>
Special note: Taking <a href="choline.html">choline</a> with piracetam is highly recommended, for reasons elucidated on the choline page.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) "Increase in the power of human memory in normal man through the use of drugs"<br>
Subjects were given 1.6g Piracetam 3x daily. No effect after 7 days, but after
14 days verbal memory significantly increased vs. subjects given a placebo.<br>
<br>
2) "Piracetam in elderly psychiatric patients with mild diffuse cerebral impairment"<br>
Subjects were given 4.8g/day or 2.4g/day Piracetam. Both groups showed significant improvement versus the placebo group, but the 4.8g/day group had more rapid onset of theraputic effect. However, after 12 weeks the 4.8g/day group showed decreased effect vs. the 2.4g/day groups, due to overstimulation or tolerance.<br>
<br>
3) "High versus low-dose Piracetam in alcohol organic mental disorder: a placebo controlled study"<br>
Subjects given 2.4g/day showed no improvement vs. placebo. Subjects given 4.8g/day showed improvement vs. placebo.<br>
