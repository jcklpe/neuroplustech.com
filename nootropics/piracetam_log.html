PIRACETAM: PERSONAL LOG

November 1, 2011: began taking Piracetam, at 4.8g/day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No significant effect, just a vague feeling of my mental machinery shifting --
and a peculiarly lucid daydream of a deer being drained of its blood.<br>
November 4: attack dosing ends, Piracetam dosage is decreased to 2.4g/day<br>
November 10: my memory begins to seem abnormally clear and effective<br>
November 12: 45min - 1.5hr after taking Piracetam, I notice a sense of calm, mild happiness, and clearheadedness. This effect occurs every time I take Piracetam from this point forward.<br>
November 17: Pure Piracetam experiments are over. I have begun taking Vinpocetine.[I stopped taking Vinpocetine two days later]<br>
January 25, 2012: I have found that I occasionally develop headache after taking Piracetam. Courtesy of one Matt Bader, I have been informed of the necessity of taking choline in some form concurrently with piracetam, and have found that any headache I develop is diffused 50+/-10 minutes after taking 0.5g choline bitartrate.<br>
January 31: Over the past several days I have found that by restricting my choline intake I can induce a headache 60 +/- 20 minutes after taking a dose of piracetam, and that this effect is consistent. Furthermore, taking choline after this headache is present causes it to dissipate within 50 +/- 10 minutes consistently. Further research also supports the importance of choline in conjunction with piracetam. I have updated Piracetam's technical summary to include this information.<br>
<br>
Personal conclusion: Piracetam is highly recommended. Its side effects (in me) are nonexistent, and it produces a moderate positive effect, both on cognition and mood.<br>
Note: In myself and several others I have given piracetam, in addition to various anecdotal
accounts of its effects on the internet, a strangely specific effect has consistently
occurred. people become disinterested in mindless fun and find
otherwise dry pursuits, such as reading textbooks, immensely enjoyable.
