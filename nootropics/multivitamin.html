I began taking a standard, generic (Target store brand, if you must know) multivitamin on November 9.<br> It should have no effect on me. However, many nutrient deficiencies have been tied to decreases<br> in cognitive function (yes, I'll add sources if you really want them, but malnutrition<br> isn't exactly poorly understood or unaccepted), so I wanted to ensure that I didn't<br> have any nutrient deficiencies I was unaware of. I noted no change in myself after I began<br> taking a daily multivitamin.
